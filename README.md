KiboSupport provides a view on the agent dashboard that showcases the most relevant call statistics in the different call lists, when the agent first logs into Kibosupport. The view consists of waiting call list, inprogress calls list, abandoned calls list and completed calls list. These call lists include the calls that are new and open and assigned to particular agents' groups.
